# DAG-based Performance Model

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caparrov/ERM/blob/master/resources/perf-model-overview.png "")



We propose a DAG-based performance model that considers the execution of the computationDAG on the abstraction of a single-core processor that exhibits a wider range of platform parametersthan those in Fig. 2.2 aimed at capturing the main features of the modern microarchitecturesin Figs. 2.3â€“2.5. Our goal is to achieve higher accuracy and deeper insights into the interactionof the application with the modeled hardware resources than prior classical models. Due to theincreased complexity of the microarchitectural model, our approach requires a simulation tool toboth dynamically generate and analyze the DAG.



ERM is based on a novel DAG-based performance model that extendsclassical analytical high-level DAG-based models to consider a more detailed abstractionof a processor core
